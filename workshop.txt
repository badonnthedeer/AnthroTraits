title=Anthro Traits
description=NOW IN BETA FOR BUILD 42!
description=Have you ever wondered what a real-life furry might experience during the zombie apocalypse? This mod--Anthro Traits--attempts to answer this question by adding in relatively realistic and balanced traits that are specific to Anthros. Choose between traits like Carnivore, Herbivore, Hoofed, Beast of Burden, or even... Stinky? Customize almost everything about these traits, including how strong they are, how many points they're worth, and more! Roleplay your fursona, a popular character, or any other Anthro in your quest to Die Just the Way you Want!
