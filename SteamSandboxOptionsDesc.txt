# AnthroTraits
A mod for Project Zomboid that adds realistic, balanced traits for anthropomorphic player characters, and integrates with mods that provide furry player models.
[h1]A message from the creator[/h1]
Do you really enjoy this mod--or even better--want to build on it?  Please consider [url=https://ko-fi.com/badonnthedeer]donating to me[/url] so I can pay my bills. I'm recently unemployed and every little bit helps!
[h1]Sandbox Options[/h1]
This mod uses sandbox options to give you the most configurable experience I can. Each trait has their own cost section, and its use is obvious so that won't be covered in this document.
It's advised to leave them on default settings.
